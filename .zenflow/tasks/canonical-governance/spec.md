# Feature: Phase 12 — Canonical System Governance

## Technical Context
Integrating SPEC-12 and SPEC-13 expanded rules. This involves:
- Enforcing the **Canonical System Prompt**.
- Scaling out the **Convex Function Catalog** (Scaffolding).
- Implementing **Workpools** and **Incremental Validators**.

## Convex Function Inventory (To Scaffold)
- `analytics.ts`: Funnel and usage metrics.
- `maintenance.ts`: Re-embedding and cleanup.
- `payments.ts`: Telegram Stars and Stripe gateway.
- `files.ts`: Metadata and upload sessions.

## Determinism Boundaries
Refining `agents.ts` to use the strict Tool Schema.
Refining `leads.ts` to include all cataloged mutations.
